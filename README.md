## Building Netflix from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context, Portal), Firebase, Compound & Styled Components (http://bit.ly/CognitiveSurge)

This application (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components. I built this Netflix clone for Scrimba (https://scrimba.com) -- Scrimba allows you to learn to code with interactive tutorials. The course itself is over 7 hours long and is available to watch on Scrimba's front-end engineering career path: https://scrimba.com/path/gfrontend - I highly recommend it, there's lots of awesome content! 70 hours of content, and 100+ coding challenges, so be sure to check it out!

I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. There's four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

I chose to use compound components for my components, and there's over 10 examples as to how these are used. The styling is all handled via styled components.

Subscribe to my YouTube channel here: http://bit.ly/CognitiveSurge where I build projects like this! And don't forget, you can contribute to this project (highly encouraged!). One thing I didn't get time to do was incorporate accessibility into this application, so I'd love to see that added!
